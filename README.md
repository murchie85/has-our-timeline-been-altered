# HAS OUR TIMELINE BEEN ALTERED?

![](image.png)

## SUMMARY 

I am thinking of a way to tell if our timeline has been altered.    

My plan is to develop a baseline for events that are normal, and a metric for those that are unlikely.
An example of an unlikely event could include a political decision resulting in a war. 

Then I will map all these events onto a trend line.

I will then consider how significant these unlikely events have impacted our timeline - i.e. what would have happened if Japan didn't attack Pearl Harbour 

I would then perform analysis on the most unlikely events that have had the biggest impact, to look for inconsistencies or chains of unlikely, large impacting events having any form of connection/causality. 

  

The project goal is to develop a system for detecting alterations in the timeline by establishing a baseline of normal events and metrics, mapping events onto a trend line, analyzing unlikely events that have had a significant impact on the timeline, and identifying chains of unlikely events and their potential causes. The system will require developing algorithms to calculate metrics for each event, statistical analysis to identify the impact of unlikely events, and a trend line visualization tool to display events over time. The project will require access to comprehensive historical data, statistical analysis software, and programming skills for algorithm development. The objective is to detect inconsistencies or chains of unlikely, large impacting events that may indicate timeline alterations.

2. Document all assumptions and decisions made throughout the project to ensure transparency and reproducibility




# OBJECTIVE 1 Baseline for normal events 

1. Historical analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis of historical events for the time period and location you're examining. Look for patterns in events that are considered "normal" or typical for that time period. For example, if you're examining the 20th century in the United States, you might consider events such as presidential elections, changes in the economy, or social movements.

2. Expert input: Consult with subject matter experts to get their input on what events and metrics should be considered normal for the time period and location you're examining. Experts may be able to provide insights that are not readily apparent from historical data analysis alone.

3. Statistical analysis: Use statistical methods to identify events and metrics that fall within a normal range of variation. For example, you could use standard deviation to identify events that are within one or two standard deviations of the mean.

4. Comparative analysis: Compare the events and metrics for the time period and location you're examining to those of other similar time periods and locations. This can help identify events and metrics that are typical for a particular time period and location.
